 * The first option, Purchase Ingredients, is where players will go to select their ingredients for potions.
 * Players will start with 100 gold coins to make their purchases.
 * When they are finished, they will navigate back to the main menu and click on Arcanium.
 * In the Arcanium, players can brew different potions with their purchased ingredients.

 * When they are finished playing, players will click logout and be redirected to the landing page.
